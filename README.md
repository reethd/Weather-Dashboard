# Weather Dashboard
This website pulls data from https://openweathermap.org/ in order to provide current and upcoming weather conditions. The user searches a city at the top of the page and the current date, temperature, humidity and windspeed are displayed as well as the the same weather data for the upcoming 5 days. The webpage also saves a user's search history to local storage in order to create an interactive history bar of previously searched cities. Time functions are provided by the day.js and moment javascript libraries.
